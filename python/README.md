# DSA with python

This space is a set of collection that i used in order to implement and improve my programming skills using python mainly. Here I only store the algorithms for the typical pages such as: leetcode, geeksforgeeks(python programming), and others platform for competitive programming oriented.

NOTE: This is not a software development programs so the software good techniques or methodologies such classes, encapsulations, etc are no used, instead every program is optimized for running it fast, pass the limited time and space complexity of the system with big O analysis.

> you can also follow books: [competitive programming by Halling](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/myteaching/competitive_programming/cp2.pdf), or cracking the coding interview,[i wrote my blog for extension of it](https://wild10.github.io/blog), and also you can follow website such as topcoder, codeforces, etc.
## about Leetcode.

leet code is a folder that containt leetcode problems solved using python i use : number-problemName.py for each python program solved and you can run them using your favourity code editor or just terminal.

## how to run.

as each file.py contains a python file that you can run using bash or your favourity code editor, to be as in competitive programming style i used in.in file to put the input of the problems so i can exactly simulate the input entry and no have an issue with extend input or some space or typing problems while testing the code( good practice in ICPC).

```bash
	python3 number-problemName.py <in.in
```
